          Citizen Hero uses software to bridge the gap between citizens and
          politics, empowering the common people to participate in politics and
          ensure that they are fairly represented. Users of Citizen Hero are
          able to track all recent and upcoming votes in the Parliament. Users
          have access to information on how and when their representatives voted
          on these issues, and if they believe they aren't doing enough, they
          can personalise templates and send them to their representatives in a
          matter of minutes.
